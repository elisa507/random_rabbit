# Random Rabbit

Naive implementation of the Random Rabbit web service. 
The app selects a random number [0:1000] and a random time (s) [1:10] and
displays the number after the randomly selected delay. The page is
simply reloaded every 1 second (given that the minimum delay is 1 s).

In the first page it's possible to set optional parameters.

This app was created using python3.8, and developed using PyCharm. 
If opened in PyCharm, once the virtual environment is created the required
packages are recognised and should be installed.
Then running the main script runs the app.
